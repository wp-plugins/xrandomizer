# XDaRk Core (support for PHAR files; i.e. PHP Archives).
# Specifically; this adds support for the XDaRk Core webPhar implementation.
# See: http://php.net/manual/en/phar.webphar.php

# We need PATH_INFO to be enabled at all times.
# This is already enabled for PHP scripts by most web hosts.
# See: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#acceptpathinfo

# Apache™ should handle this fine without any further hassle.
# This is possible because of the MIME module that comes with Apache™ 2.x;
# (where `.php.phar` reverts to `.php` if `.phar` is not associated with a MIME type yet).
# So as long as the PHAR file ends with `.php.phar` (which it does); we're good here.
# See: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_mime.html#multipleext

# Specifically for LiteSpeed™ (we can guess this w/ some certainty).
# This assumes LiteSpeed™ is NOT configured to handle PHAR files already.
# We also assume the standard PHP MIME type is in use (application/x-httpd-php).
# Could also try: application/x-httpd-php5, application/x-httpd-php53, application/x-httpd-php54
